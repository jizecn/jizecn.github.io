  Abstract                 = {Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) are increasingly used for ocean missions, which typically require long duration of operations under strict energy constraints. Consequently, there is an increased interest in energy efficient path planning for USVs. This work proposes a novel energy efficient path planning algorithm to address the challenges with the presence of spatially-temporally variant sea current and complex geographic map data, by integrating the following algorithms, namely Voronoi roadmap, Dijkstra's searching, coastline expanding and genetic algorithm (GA). The selection, crossover and mutation operators are employed as part of the GA algorithm. The dividing, smoothing and exchanging operators are proposed to improve the quality of the path and adapt to the Voronoi-Visibility roadmap. The Global Self-Consistent Hierarchical High-Resolution Shorelines dataset and historical sea current dataset are applied to demonstrate the flexibility and practicability of the proposed algorithm. To evaluate the performance, the Voronoi-GA energy efficient algorithm and Voronoi-Visibility energy efficient path re-planning algorithm are also implemented to provide the baseline for comparison. The proposed algorithm generates the most energy efficient paths in ten USV missions, while keeping a configurable clearance from the coastlines. The practicability and scalability of this algorithm is also demonstrated by analysing the computational time in these ten missions.},

  Abstract                 = {Situational awareness in remote environments is crucial for human operators to teleoperate mobile manipulators confidently and reliably. Visual feedback is the most common way for environment perception, providing rich information to human operators. This paper proposes an intuitive teleoperation method by combining gaze tracking and hand motion detection to teleoperate a mobile manipulator. A camera is fixed on the end-effector of the mobile robot's arm to provide visual feedback, acting as the eye of the teleoperator. Rather than direct remote control of the robot, an adaptive auto-correction mechanism is introduced for helping human operators to achieve better hand-eye coordination of the teleoperation experiences. The mobile manipulator can adjust its behaviours, such as speed, while gaze and hand movements of the operator are in different states. The experiments carried out demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the survey evaluation verified the practical application value of the system.},
