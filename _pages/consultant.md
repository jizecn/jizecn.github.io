With years of research and development in academic and industrial environments, I have proven experience to design, implement, review, and deliver reliable products with thorough theoretical problem understanding and analyses.

Rather than an ivory tower academic, I always consider myself an engineer first. I believe R&D needs to be more driven by real-world challenges in order to have greater impact.

Please do not hesitate to get in touch if we can help with your problems or collaborate. 


I have been working on: 
  - [Dyson 360](https://www.dyson.co.uk/vacuum-cleaners/robot-vacuums/dyson-360-heurist/dyson-360-heurist-overview) as a robotics system engineer, responsible for various research-focused challenges
  - [L3 ASV](https://www.asvglobal.com/), as a unmanned system engineer, delivering projects of different types independently or as a team 
  - [Lenovo Research Headquater](http://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/index.html) as a robotics architect/technical lead
  - Several EU funded projects working on mobile robots/autonomous navigation
  - Vision Tracking for multiple objects
  - Robot-based 3D surface imaging for micro-scale texture metrology
  - Computer vision for manufacturing, e.g. quality inspection of nano-scaled lithography surfaces and spattering characterisation of metal additive manufacturing
  - ... to be updated ...
